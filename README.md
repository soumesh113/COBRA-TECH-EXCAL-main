                                                              MEDICINE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
                                                   
1. Background/Problem Statement:
   
Across all of India, many people are still living in extreme poverty. For such people it is extremely difficult to pay for their health care and medication.
As a result, they suffer from various diseases, and there is a daily increase in disease-caused deaths among such people. Therefore, to provide a measure 
for reducing such problems, we have set up a website which provides the facility for all kinds of people to donate their unrequired medicines to NGOs,
as well as facilitating and organizing their delivery to people that require them. 

This system thus aims to solve various problems that are prevalent in offline distribution systems such as:
i)   Excessive man power
ii)  Purchasing and managing expensive medicines.
iii) Difficulty in finding needy people.
iv)  Difficulty in finding or utilizing leftover medicines.


2. Working:

The Medicine Distribution System proposed here aims at providing an online platform for donating unused or unrequired medicines to needy people.On this 
platform, users can register themselves by providing their necessary details. Once registered as donors, the users can provide the required details for the
concerned medicines, as well as the pickup address, and these details will be verified by an admin, after which they can be approved and available for 
other users to request. The System will maintain a record of avaiable and donated medicines as well as their status. The system and delivery can be managed 
by an appropriate NGO.

3. Sytem Description:

1) Admin: The appointed admin can login into the system with their speicific credentials. They can view all the medicine details that have been filled in by
          a donator, according to specific categories, and either approve or delete them after viewing the details. The website also allows them to edit
          their account information at any time. The admin can also assign deliveries for approved and requested medicines, and check them off as delivered 
          once the delivery is made.
          
 2) User: The user can login to the system with their specific credentials. Donators can fill a form to provide information about their medicines along with
          pickup addresses. Other users can view all the medicines that have been approved by an admin, and put up requests for them as well as provide their
          delivery addresses. All users can edit their account information at any time.
